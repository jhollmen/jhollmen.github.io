    <h1>IEEE ICDM 2019 Workshop on Interpretable and Explainable Machine Learning for Healthcare (IX-ML-HEALTH)</h1>
    
    The workshop on Interpretable and Explainable Machine Learning for Healthcare is organized as a half-day workshop at the 19th IEEE
    International Conference on Data Mining (<a href="http://icdm2019.bigke.org">IEEE ICDM 2019</a>) in Beijing, China during November 8,
    2019.<p>

    <em>Due to the low number of submissions we received, the workshop is cancelled. The submissions have been forwarded to another health related
    workshop</em>.<p>

      <h2>Call for papers</h2>
      
      The workshop will provide a forum for researchers to exchange ideas
      and disseminate research results in learning interpretable and
      explainable machine learning models, especially in the context of
      healthcare data. Healthcare systems accumulate patient data, and
      analysis and modeling of the data can provide novel insights to
      healthcare. Submissions to the workshop should explore the concept
      of interpretability or explainabilty in the context of healthcare
      data.

      Submission topics of the workshop include the following, in the
      context of healthcare data:

      <ul>
	<li>Learning interpretable models
	<li>Interpretability and explainability in modeling</li>
	<li>Learning interpretable models, such as rules or trees</li>
	<li>Parsimonious models</li>
	<li>Sparse models for interpretation</li>
	<li>Linguistic descriptions of findings</li>
	<li>Global and local interpretability</li>
	<li>Approximating and explaining black-box models</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Submission information</h2>

      The papers for the workshop will be submitted with the same submission system as for the main conference IEEE ICDM, the following link to
      goes to the
      <a href="https://wi-lab.com/cyberchair/2019/icdm19/scripts/ws_submit.php?subarea=S">submission system</a>. The style of the workshop
      papers will follow the format of the main conference. Select the IX-ML-HEALTH workshop from the list.<p>

      Submission system is closed.<p>

      <h2>Important dates for the workshop</h2>
