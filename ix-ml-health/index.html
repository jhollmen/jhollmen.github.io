<h1>Workshop on Interpretable and Explainable Machine Learning for Healthcare</h1>

Half-day workshop at The 19th IEEE International Conference on Data
Mining (IEEE ICDM 2019) in Beijing, China

Date: November 8, 2019

Website: https://jhollmen.github.io/ix-ml-health/

The program committee will be assembled from the network of researchers and collaborators.

<h2>Call for papers</h2>

The workshop will provide a forum for researchers to exchange ideas
and disseminate research results in learning interpretable and
explainable machine learning models, especially in the context of
healthcare data. Healthcare systems accumulate patient data, and
analysis and modeling of the data can provide novel insights to
healthcare. Submissions to the workshop should explore the concept
of interpretability or explainabilty in the context of healthcare
data.

Submission topics of the workshop include the following, in the
context of healthcare data:

<ul>
  <li>Learning interpretable models
  <li>Interpretability and explainability in modeling</li>
  <li>Learning interpretable models, such as rules or trees</li>
  <li>Parsimonious models</li>
  <li>Sparse models for interpretation</li>
  <li>Linguistic descriptions of findings</li>
  <li>Global and local interpretability</li>
  <li>Approximating and explaining black-box models</li>
</ul>
